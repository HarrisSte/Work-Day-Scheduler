# Contribtions

For this project, I utilized multiple resources to help me devleop this application. I worked with my tutor, Ben Martin, to help solve an issue I faced. I also attended office hours and spoke directly to my instructor. In addition to this, I combed through the numerous resources provided by my instructor and TAs in the boot camp aided in supplementing my process of developing this project. I referenced various outside sources, such as websites and tutorial videos, through W3Schools, MDN, Medium, and StackOverflow. I also conferred with my classmates.
